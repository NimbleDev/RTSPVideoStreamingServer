RTSPVideoStreamingServer provide the streaming of several video files.
Moreover, it can take in input a folder with images to create a video file which will be streamed.

It is avalable on Python3. I don't know if it works with Python2 because I don't want use it.

For the moment, you can use it like a simple script:

$ python3 RTSPVideoStreamingServer <medias folder> <display mode of streaming url: console or file> <loop mode>
